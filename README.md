Overview
=========

This is my website. It is written using python and the flask framework.

My initial version consists of a single page, it will be updated with stuff
eventually.

Setup
========

To setup the flask python virtual environment for this project execute
~/$ . venv/bin/activate

To run the test server run:
~/$ python routes.py

and point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/


TODO
======
* clean up referenced libraries
* get colour in social media icons
* Somehow my references seem to have gone missing. Should add links to the
various tutorials I used in making this website 
* update with social network graph
* add links to work on sf scraper
